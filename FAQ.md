## FAQ

### Why are some characters missing?
Because I made this mod with [Longevity's](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/649?tab=files) DNPCC in mind. I didn't want the outfits to have a huge overlap and also the sprites they have are wonderful! We do not have permission to upload their artwork, so if you want to combine the two outfit sets, you will have to add them to the mod and only use it personally. [Content patcher instructions are here](https://github.com/Pathoschild/StardewMods/tree/stable/ContentPatcher#readme).

### Can you do a version of this that's compatible with ________?
Maybe! I don't have a ton of free time, so if I do it'll probably be a long time. Leave me a request in the posts section. Also, if you really would like to do a crossover version with your favorite mod and you want to create it, you totally have permission on my end (don't forget to ask the other mod author of whichever mod you want to combine it with). I will happily add it to the mod.

### May I contribute my own art for portraits and such?
YES! Please! Comment in the posts section or send me or paradigmnomad a DM with your wonderful artwork and we'll add it to the next update.

### Can you do a sprite of (some character) for (some situation)?
Maybe! Again, leave a request in the posts and I might do it. I am also totally accepting people submitting their designs for outfits if you want to send it to me.

### I found a problem! Can you fix it?
Yes. Let me know what it is.
